# Performance Analysis and Optimization Report

## Executive Summary

This analysis identifies several performance bottlenecks in the json2csv Go application and provides concrete optimization recommendations. The current binary size is 2.9MB, which can be reduced to 1.9MB (34% reduction) with basic optimizations.

## Current Performance Metrics

- **Binary Size**: 2,920,447 bytes (2.9MB)
- **Optimized Binary Size**: 1,913,016 bytes (1.9MB) - 34% reduction
- **Go Version**: 1.24.2 (modern version, good for optimizations)
- **Dependencies**: 1 external dependency (github.com/astaxie/flatmap)

## Identified Performance Bottlenecks

### 1. Binary Size Issues
- **Issue**: Large binary size (2.9MB) for a simple CLI tool
- **Root Cause**: Debug symbols and unoptimized build flags
- **Impact**: Slower download times, larger deployment footprint

### 2. Memory Allocation Inefficiencies
- **Issue**: Multiple string allocations in hot paths
- **Root Cause**: 
  - `strings.Split()` creates new slices on every call
  - String concatenation in `getValue()` function
  - Repeated JSON marshaling for complex types
- **Impact**: Higher memory usage, GC pressure

### 3. I/O Performance Issues
- **Issue**: Inefficient file I/O and CSV writing
- **Root Cause**:
  - `w.Flush()` called after every record write
  - No buffering optimization
  - Single-threaded processing
- **Impact**: Slower processing of large files

### 4. Algorithmic Inefficiencies
- **Issue**: Recursive key expansion on every record
- **Root Cause**:
  - `strings.Split(key, ".")` called repeatedly for same keys
  - `getValue()` uses recursive approach instead of iterative
- **Impact**: CPU overhead for large datasets

### 5. Dependency Overhead
- **Issue**: External dependency for simple map flattening
- **Root Cause**: `github.com/astaxie/flatmap` adds binary size
- **Impact**: Larger binary, potential security/maintenance concerns

## Optimization Recommendations

### 1. Build Optimization (Immediate - Low Risk)
```bash
# Current build flags that should be used
go build -ldflags="-s -w" -trimpath -o json2csv ./cmd/...
```
- **Expected Impact**: 34% binary size reduction (2.9MB → 1.9MB)
- **Risk**: None

### 2. Memory Optimization (High Impact - Medium Risk)
- Pre-allocate slices with known capacity
- Cache split keys to avoid repeated string operations
- Use string builder for concatenation
- Implement object pooling for frequently allocated objects

### 3. I/O Optimization (High Impact - Low Risk)
- Batch CSV writes instead of flushing after each record
- Implement configurable buffer sizes
- Add parallel processing for large files

### 4. Algorithm Optimization (Medium Impact - Low Risk)
- Replace recursive `getValue()` with iterative approach
- Cache expanded keys to avoid repeated splitting
- Optimize JSON unmarshaling with streaming parser for large files

### 5. Dependency Reduction (Medium Impact - Medium Risk)
- Replace `github.com/astaxie/flatmap` with custom implementation
- Reduce external dependencies to improve security and reduce binary size

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Low Risk, High Impact)
1. ✅ Build optimization with proper flags
2. I/O batching optimization
3. Key caching optimization

### Phase 2: Algorithm Improvements (Medium Risk, High Impact)
1. Memory allocation optimization
2. Iterative getValue implementation
3. Streaming JSON processing

### Phase 3: Dependency Optimization (Higher Risk, Medium Impact)
1. Custom flatmap implementation
2. Dependency elimination

## Estimated Performance Improvements

- **Binary Size**: 34% reduction (already achieved)
- **Memory Usage**: 40-60% reduction (estimated)
- **Processing Speed**: 2-3x improvement for large files
- **Startup Time**: 20-30% improvement

## Monitoring and Validation

Recommended benchmarks to validate optimizations:
1. Binary size comparison
2. Memory usage profiling
3. CPU profiling with large datasets
4. I/O throughput benchmarks
5. End-to-end processing time tests

## Next Steps

1. Implement Phase 1 optimizations
2. Create comprehensive benchmark suite
3. Validate performance improvements
4. Implement Phase 2 optimizations
5. Monitor production performance
